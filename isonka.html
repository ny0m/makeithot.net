        <p class="left">Growing up in the Eastern Cape in South Africa introduced Brad to house music from a young age.
            What started off as an inability to stay off the dance floor soon became an obsession with collecting dance
            music of all kinds.</p>
        <p class="left">On a lifelong quest to truly understand house music, he strives to learn from the sounds of
            South African Kwaito, Detroit and Chicago house, and house music from the 90s. These lessons,
            coupled with tracks that are often funky and sometimes soulful, and bringing in elements of old-school
            disco, across vinyl and digital, give his sets a versatile and genre-blending flavour.</p>
        <p class="left">An avid crowd-reader, his sets might be filled with easygoing house and disco, or rare tracks
            from his extensive collection—he spends some time every single day looking for music; either listening to
            new music online, looking for vinyls on Discogs, or digging through record store shelves.</p>
        <p class="left">He's played at Plåtparken in Stockholm, Repeat Bar and SoundCloud HQ in Berlin, and been booked
            for private events in South Africa, Germany, and Sweden.</p>
        <p class="left">He's also one half of <a class="gradient" href="http://makeithot.net">Make It Hot</a>, a
            soul-flavoured house music party that had its first (pumping) takeover at Talking to Strangers in
            Cape Town this year.</p>
